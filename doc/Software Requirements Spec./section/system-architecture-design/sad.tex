\section{System Architecture Design}

The \textbf{context diagram} of the system is shown in: Figure \ref{fig:sys-context},
which indicates that the system has no dependences on outer systems.

The \textbf{system architecture diagram} is shown in: Figure \ref{fig:sys-arch}.

The system will follow the MVC design pattern since the client end of the system will be web browser.
And obviously, it follows the layer pattern.

\textbf{$\ast$Notice} that component with {\color{OrangeRed} red box} is designed for future development of this system itself.
It might not be implemented within the scope of the class project but it will still have interfaces defined.
