\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}

We define a system named \textbf{ICDE-ScholarHub} which is a web-based Paper Search Engine with ICDE concepts implemented.

The system will practice the idea of ICDE to help the researchers work more efficiently regarding user operation history, teamwork, and paper trending.

Furthermore, the system exposes the API of ICDE for the development of 3rd-party applications or plugins.


\section{Sytem Problem Statement}

During the daily research work, it always happens that researchers forget some critical paper they have read on the web-based paper search system a long-time ago. It takes time to find the critical one from the huge amount of paper list from a different academic area.

More sadly, people may miss the latest paper which is important to their research. Researchers have supervisors, colleagues, and teammates. They like to share the latest paper in the same area with the team. But they do not want to disturb others by sending papers through email too often and it is not well organized.

If there is a  system that implements ICDE API, the reading history will be well recorded. The system will log down every activity the user performed.

For example, the researcher can develop a small tool to log down his paper reading history; the research team can develop a tool for sharing team memberâ€™s paper reading history,  paper marking history, area preference, and so on.

The aim of using ICDE-ScholarHub on the paper search system is to help the researchers and their teams work in a more efficient way.
